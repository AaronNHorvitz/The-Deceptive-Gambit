Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further growth of science and knowledge, or to enrich the
global cultural heritage.

When exercising Nominating Rights, the person making the Work available
(the "Affirmer") may designate an Owner to receive attribution rights, if
any, separate from Copyright and Related Rights. The Affirmer may also
designate an Affirmer-Identified Steward to receive notifications related
to the Work.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Affirmer remains the owner of the Work
until the Affirmer relinquishes ownership of the Work to the public.

To the extent possible under law, Affirmer has waived all copyright and
related or neighboring rights to this work.
